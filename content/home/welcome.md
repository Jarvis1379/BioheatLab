Biological systems constantly interact with their surroundings by exchanging substances and energy in various forms and scales that are necessary for sustaining metabolic activities in living and growth. Through the interdisciplinary study of thermal physics and biology, we intend to build new concepts of bio-thermal physics for a better understanding of the living system and its interactions with thermal energy, and thus to develop novel energy-based systemic approaches to cancer.
